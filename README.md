# hello-world
My most non-recent repository.

My name's Daniel. I am 90% human (The 10% being glasses, braces, hearing aids, and a fake arm).
I enjoy breathing and sleeping. My skills are focussed around focussing. I am a world class focusser.
I hope to meet other beings that enjoy breathing and sleeping. Thank you for unwillingly accepting
myself into your community.
